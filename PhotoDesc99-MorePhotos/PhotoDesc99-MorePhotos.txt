Jeff, 

I forgot to include these photos in my previous emails, but wanted to make sure they were included. 
The top photo is me and Hercules Bones, on the day he was rescued and transported from FL to MO. 
The rest of the photos are of Figaro, a stray cat who showed up last winter. He was emaciated, 
freezing, and terrified of everything and everyone. We provided him with heated shelter, food, 
water, and general care (flea/tick preventative, etc.) while coaxing him to trust us. After 2-3 
months, we were able to come within a few feet of him and even touch him briefly at times. Now, 
he is friendlier with familiar adults but still refuses to come inside or be handled. We donâ€™t 
know where he came from, but are thankful he is cared for and healthy now.
